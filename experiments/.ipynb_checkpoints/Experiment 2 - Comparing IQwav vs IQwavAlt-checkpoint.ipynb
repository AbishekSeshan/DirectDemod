    "Two implementations to read IQ.wav files was written in source.py, one using np.memmap and the other using scipy's wavread function. The benefit of using scipy's wavread is that it allows us to read in the sampling frequency easily unlike the np.memmap. Hence a comparison was required to compare both. IQwav object is the scipy version where as IQwavAlt is the np.memmap version.\n",
